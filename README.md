# About this project

TRPO 2017 project #1

This is the stateless-application with REST-interface for validation Json files.

Requirements:

    source code is hosted in the public git repository
    the project runs in the Docker directly from the repository
    a service running in the Docker does not store state

Non-functional requirements:

    Strictly follow the Java Convention when naming classes, methods, and the formation of Java doc
    To conduct development iteratively, i.e. make commits in git as the new feature is implemented.

Samples:

Run container with service:

    docker run -d -p 80:80 github.com/username/projectname

Send file to validation:

    curl -s --data-binary @filename.json http://localhost

Example of service response in case of error:

    {
     "errorCode"  : 123,
     "errorMessage" : ["verbose, plain language description of the problem with hints about how to fix it]",
     "errorPlace" : ["highlight the point where error has occurred"],
     "resource"   : ["filename"],
     "request-id" : ["the request id generated by the API for easier tracking of errors"]
    }
